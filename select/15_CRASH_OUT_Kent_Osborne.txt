i woke up this morning and i'm feeling like the man
shawty crushing on me i feel like im high demand
you can't even do shit you ain't got a plan
how the fuck bossing but you working for the man

i just light shit up and crash out
i just want to die and crash out

oh my god i feel fantastic
hard to be ya self when you stay codependent
hard to be ya self and i stay independent
hard to be ya self when ain't nobody get it
this a fact check and everybody get it
i just light shit up and crash out
i just want to die and crash out
what da fuck is wrong i spazz out
oh my god i feel fantastic
