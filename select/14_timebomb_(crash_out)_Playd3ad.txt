My heads a time bomb
Wish there was a way to turn my mind off
Gravity keeps holding me down
If I fell would you hear a sound

I cannot turn off my phone got a hold over me
I've kept grudges for years ain't nothing goin over me
Ive been stressin so hard think I might overheat
Losin my shit in the SUV 4 seat
Pissed off my emotions control me

Cash my ticket and get away
Imma hit that shit hit that shit
Till Im far from this place

Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
Watch it all crash as I crash out
