All of the fun things
That I couldn't type back
I won't hold my breath but
You say you'll be right back
LA to New York
Catching a flight back
I'm on a Greyhound
And you're flying first class
Somehow I fall short
I learned how to fall back
Don't know what to call this
It's not like you'd call back

Last night
You fucked up, don't start with me
Crash out on the lawn
Throwing car keys, nice shot
Long story short, lost a part of me
My god, what's it take for an apology?
Last night
You fucked up, don't start with me
Crash out on the lawn
Throwing car keys, nice shot
Long story short, lost a part of me
My god, what's it take for an apology?

I don't wanna hurt you
But I wanna fight back
I don't wanna fuck you
I just want my time back
I pull the punches
You're pulling your hair back
I might just crash out
Deploy all the airbags
I put the car in park to tell you I'm over it
You pull down the handbrake
Tell me to get over it
Drop you at the neighbor's house
And I'm breaking down again
I lost the love I don't think I ever found again

Last night
You fucked up, don't start with me
Crash out on the lawn
Throwing car keys, nice shot
Long story short, lost a part of me
My god, what's it take for an apology?
Last night
You fucked up, don't start with me
Crash out on the lawn
Throwing car keys, nice shot
Long story short, lost a part of me
My god, what's it take for an apology?

Now we're in autumn
The weather is cold again
It's only a few months
But it's getting old again
I told my brother
That I'd never fold again
But love is a death threat
And it's got ahold of me
It's got ahold of me
