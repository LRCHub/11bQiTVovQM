(Thank you, Timmy boy)

Bitch, I'm pushin' P
He tried to arrest a nigga, I'm back pushin' B
Thirty milligram of Oxycodone, bitch, I'm poppin' three
I rock Denim Tears with Saint Laurent mixed with the Louis V
I just cracked a pint and poured the full cream soda, Booka T
I just cracked a pint and poured a four, I should've poured a three
I've been steppin' in my Ricky shoes and Ricky on my sleeve
My lil' bitch, she bald head, I like her, she look just like Eve
I can't wake up and be still broke, there's money in my dreams

Ricky Owen head to head, diamonds VVS or VS1s
Strikers tried to pull me out, you know I had to run
Thirty shots stuffed in the magazine, I don't even know who gun
In the bank with all my crash outs, but, bitch, I'm a crash out boy

Had the coroner pop my lock, I bet all them niggas run
I gotta ride with two three four clips
'cause this piece that's on my gun
He won't make it out that spot because I—
He won't make it out that spot
Because I owe 'em when they done
Where my feelings?
Ayy, I've been hustlin' since a child, it's in my DNA
You gon' catch me on my block or either at the bank
This whole machine gun conversion, not no fuckin' shank
I don't give a fuck—

Shooters puttin' BTA, I call 'em, what's the ETA?
FaceTime a route on 95, they throwin 360 Kmh
Why the fuck you up palmer like you's a killer? You's a saint
I put blood right on these diamonds
Killed the chicken and the saint, damn

Rockstar lifestyle, might not live
GTA lifestyle, but I'm gon' live it
I put diamonds in my body, bro put diamonds in his bracelet
I keep throwin' up my Z's for Zombieland
They think I'm Haitian
(Crash Out Boyz)

Brand-new Patek, I don't even wanna wear it
Just leave it inside the case
I do fraud, where them phones at?
Or just point me to a Chase
I got wheel, bet I get it where it's—
I got wheel, bet I get away every time I'm in a Chase
Where lil bronem, you know they bang them S's, for me
They slang a Drac'
Reservations just for lunch, you know I spend what you make today
I might pull up brand-new Bentley, just might—
I might pull up brand-new Bentley
Just make one of you niggas fake

Rockstar lifestyle, might not live
GTA lifestyle, but I'm gon' live it
I put diamonds in my body, bro put diamonds in his bracelet
I keep throwin' up my Z's for Zombieland, they think I'm Haitian
